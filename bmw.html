                <h2>HISTORY OF BMW</h2>
                <p>BMW AG originated with three other manufacturing companies, Rapp Motorenwerke and Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFw) in Bavaria, and Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach in Thuringia. Aircraft engine manufacturer Rapp Motorenwerke became Bayerische Motorenwerke in 1916. The engine manufacturer, which built proprietary industrial engines after World War I, was then bought by the owner of BFw who then merged BFw into BMW and moved the engine works onto BFw's premises. BFw's motorcycle sideline was improved upon by BMW and became an integral part of their business.</p>
                <p>BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1929 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque. BMW's team of engineers progressively developed their cars from small Seven-based cars into six-cylinder luxury cars and, in 1936, began production of the BMW 328 sports car. Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production, with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture stopped altogether.</p>
                <p>BMW began building cars in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. Sales of their luxury saloons were too small to be profitable, so BMW supplemented this with building Isettas under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars caused the BMW board to consider selling the operation to Daimler-Benz. However, Herbert Quandt was convinced to purchase a controlling interest in BMW and to invest in its future.</p>
                <p>Quandt's investment, along with profits from the BMW 700, brought about the BMW New Class and BMW New Six. These new products, along with the absorption of Hans Glas GmbH, gave BMW a sure footing on which to expand. BMW grew in strength, eventually acquiring the Rover Group (most of which was later divested), and the license to build automobiles under the Rolls-Royce marque.</p>

                <h2>BMW i8</h2>
                <p>The BMW i8, first introduced as the BMW Concept Vision Efficient Dynamics, is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The 2015 model year BMW i8 has a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cycle, the range in EV mode is 24 km (15 mi) with a small amount of gasoline consumption.The design is heavily influenced by the BMW M1 Hommage Concept (which is itself, a retro concept of the original M1).</p>
                <p>The BMW i8 can go from 0–100 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in 4.4 seconds and has a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). The BMW i8 has a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg-imp; 112.0 mpg-US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km. EPA rated the i8 combined fuel economy at 76 equivalent (MPG-equivalent) (3.1 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent) and '29 miles per gallon' when running in pure gasoline mode (after the battery is drained empty).</p>
                <p>The initial turbodiesel concept car was unveiled at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The i8 was released in Germany in June 2014. Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. began in August 2014. Global cumulative sales totaled almost 7,200 units through December 2015. The top selling markets are the United States, the UK and Germany.</p>

                <h2>BMW M4</h2>
                <p>The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, the BMW M GmbH. Part of the renumbering that BMW splits the 3 Series coupe and convertible models to the 4 Series (to further differentiate with the 3 Series sedans), the M4 replaces the M3 Coupe and Convertible models. </p>
                <p>Upgrades over the standard 4-Series include: a very powerful and responsive, twin turbocharged engine; improved handling, suspension, and braking systems; aerodynamic body enhancements; interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour "M" (Motorsport) badging; the significantly reduced weight compared to the standard 4 series and its predecessor with an all-new stiffer chassis and extensive use of carbon fiber, especially the roof of the car. The car will be starting at $65,700 MSRP.</p>
                <p>The M4 features Active Sound. A live amplification of the engine's natural sound will be inducted into the passenger cabin via the speakers. BMW says this technology has been used so that the well insulated cabin can reduce road/wind noise but still provide the driver with the sporty sound of the M powered engine. There are no artificial sound or any pre-recorded track.</p>
                <p>On September 25 2013, BMW released technical specifications of the M4 powered by a M-tuned S55B30 engine, although it is a 3.0 L inline engine. BMW states that it is completely different to the N55 engine seen in other BMW 35i models, this engine has been built specifically for the New M4/M3, displacing 3.0 L (180 cu in) and redlining at 7,500 rpm. The rev limiter coming in at 7,600rpm. The engine uses two mono-scroll turbochargers with boost peaking at 18.1 PSI. The power is rated at 425 hp (317 kW; 431 PS) while torque will be 550 N·m (410 lb·ft). The weight of the 6 speed manual M4 is 3,556 lb (1,613 kg), with the M-DCT some 88 lb (40kg) heavier. Both 6-speed manual and 7-speed M-DCT transmissions are available. The 7-speed M-DCT transmission accelerates the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.1 seconds). The 6-speed manual transmission does 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds).</p>
