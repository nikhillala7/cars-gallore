                <h2>HISTORY OF MERCEDES</h2>
                <p>Mercedes-Benz is a German automobile manufacturer, a multinational division of the German manufacturer Daimler AG. The brand is known for luxury vehicles, buses, coaches, and trucks. The headquarters of Mercedes-Benz is in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.</p>
                <p>The name first appeared in 1926 under Daimler-Benz, but traces its origins to Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and to Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first gasoline powered automobile. Mercedes-Benz's slogan is "The Best or Nothing". Mercedes-Benz is one of the most recognized automotive brands worldwide.</p>
                <p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first petrol-powered car, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, financed by Bertha Benz and patented in January 1886 and Gottlieb Daimler and engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft. The first Mercedes-Benz brand name vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company. Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was popular during Germany's Nazi period. Adolf Hitler was known to have driven these cars during his time in power, with bulletproof windshields.</p>
                <p> Most of the surviving models have been sold at auctions to private buyers. One of them is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz has introduced many technological and safety innovations that later became common in other vehicles. Mercedes-Benz is one of the best-known and established automotive brands in the world, and is also one of the world's oldest automotive brand still in existence today in 2016, having produced the first petrol-powered car.</p>

                <h1>SLS AMG</h1>

                <h2>SLS AMG</h2>
                <p>The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG (C197 / R197) is a front-engine, 2-seater luxury, limited production supercar automobile developed by Mercedes-AMG of German automaker Mercedes-Benz and was the first Mercedes-Benz automobile designed in-house by AMG. The car, which has gull-wing doors, was the successor to the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren and was described by Mercedes-Benz as a spiritual successor to the Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing. SLS stands for "Sport Leicht Super" (Sport Light Super). The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG was assembled largely by hand, with its chassis and aluminum body shell produced by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria and then transferred to Sindelfingen, Germany for assembly, with its engine being hand built by AMG in Affalterbach, Germany.</p>
                <p>It was the first Mercedes-Benz designed and built from scratch entirely by AMG. Upon its introduction the SLS AMG's 571 PS (420 kW; 563 hp) M159 engine was according to AMG "the world's most powerful naturally aspirated production series engine" ever produced. In fact, the 6.3 liter engine was modified to such an extent that AMG gave it a separate engine code -- M159 -- to signify the more than 120 different parts used in the SLS engine (as well as the addition of a dry-sump lubrication system to handle the car's high cornering speeds and racing capabilities). The SLS AMG was also Mercedes-Benz's last naturally aspirated engine.</p>
                <p>The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, and sales commenced in mid-2010 in Europe and in mid-2011 in the United States. Mercedes presented an electric version of the car, the SLS AMG Electric Drive, at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. Production ended with the SLS AMG GT FINAL EDITION in early 2014.</p>
                <p>Compared with its predecessor (the Mercedes-McLaren SLR), the SLS is, per Mercedes-AMG head Tobias Moers, the faster car on the track, both in the hands of normal drivers as well as race drivers. This may be attributable in part to the SLS's lightweight aluminum frame—the company's first ever use of an aluminum chassis and body frame. The Mercedes SL65 AMG Black Series, by way of example, with its use of carbon and other light weight materials, had a curb weight of over two tons, at 4,350 pounds. Even the Mercedes-McLaren SLR supercar, with its emphasis on light weight, came in at 3,860 pounds. The SLS, however, has a curb weight of just 3,573 pounds, and that's with its standard wheels—it had a (very expensive) ceramic-composite brake option that reduced the unsprung weight of the wheels by 40%. The SLS also came with a carbon-fiber shaft for its dual clutch transmission. Perhaps for these reasons, the SLS AMG achieves a lateral acceleration of 0.99. This bests even the Mercedes-McLaren SLR, which achieves a 0.97 figure.</p>

                <h2>SLR</h2>
                <p>The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren is a grand tourer car jointly developed by Mercedes-Benz and McLaren Automotive, built in Portsmouth and the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, Surrey, England and sold from 2003 to 2010. When it was developed, German manufacturer Mercedes-Benz owned 40 percent of the McLaren Group. SLR stands for "Sport Leicht Rennsport" (Sport Light Racing), homage to the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR which served as the McLaren's inspiration. Both coupé and roadster versions were offered.</p>
                <p>At the 1999 North American International Auto Show, Mercedes-Benz presented their Vision SLR concept, inspired both by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé of 1955, which was a modified Mercedes-Benz W196S race car, and the design of closed-wheel Formula One cars, a field in which Mercedes had prior experience, providing engines for McLaren bodies. The car was presented as "Tomorrow Silver Arrow" in a clear reference to the Silver Arrows of the golden age of Mercedes in competition during the fifties. Later that year, during the Frankfurt Motorshow it was presented the roadster version. The concept car was presented with an AMG 5.5 litre V8 engine supercharged with a mechanical compressor able to deliver 557 HP and 720 Nm at 4,000 rpm, mated with a 5-speed automatic gearbox with Touchshift control.</p>
                <p>The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren saw a production run of over six years. On 4 April 2008, Mercedes announced it would discontinue the SLR. The last of the coupés rolled off the production line at the end of 2009 and the roadster version was dropped in early 2010. Due to the automatic gear box, front mid-engined arrangement, and its driving characteristics, some commentators classify the SLR McLaren as a GT, whose rivals would include vehicles such as the Aston Martin DBS V12 and Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano.</p>
                <p>Car and Driver achieved a 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) time of 3.4 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 11.2 seconds at 130 mph (210 km/h) C&D suggests the times may be even lower if temperatures were lower. Motor Trend tested the SLR and achieved a 0-60 mph time of 3.3 seconds in April 2006. Car and Driver achieved top gear acceleration 30-50 mph and 50-70 mph times of 1.7 and 2.4 seconds, which are the fastest ever recorded by the magazine in a production car. The SLR also pulled 1.13 g on the skidpad.</p>
