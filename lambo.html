            <h2>HISTORY OF LAMBORGHINI</h2>
            <p>Automobili Lamborghini is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars. Lamborghini's production facility and headquarters are located in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models were released in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era.</p>
            <p>Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in the company's expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.</p>
            <p>The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s (decade), during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent.</p>

            <h2>AVENDATOR LP 700-4</h2>
            <p>The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engined sports car produced by the Italian manufacturer Lamborghini. Launched on 28 February 2011 at the Geneva Motor Show, five months after its initial unveiling in Sant'Agata Bolognese, the vehicle, internally codenamed LB834, was designed to replace the ten-year-old Murciélago as the new flagship model. Soon after the Aventador unveiling, Lamborghini announced that it had already sold over 12 of the production vehicles, with deliveries starting in the second half of 2011. By June 2013, Lamborghini had already built 2,000 Aventadors, taking two years to achieve this milestone.</p>
            <p>In keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is also named after a fighting bull. Aventador was a bull that fought particularly valiantly in the bull ring of Zaragoza, Spain in 1993. The bull which the Aventador is named after earned the Trofeo de la Peña La Madroñera for its courage in the arena.</p>
            <p>The Aventador LP 700–4 uses Lamborghini's new 700 PS (510 kW; 690 bhp) 6.5 litre 60° V12 engine weighing 235 kg. Known internally as the L539, the new engine is Lamborghini's fourth in-house engine and second V12 design. It is the first all-new V12 since the 3.5 litre powerplant found in the 350GT.</p>
            <p>Production will be limited to 4,000 units (4,099 Murciélagos were built). The molds used to make the carbon-fibre monocoque are expected to last 500 units each and only 8 have been made. The base price of the Aventador is US$393,695. The car's shape also borrows heavily from Lamborghini's limited-edition Reventón and their Estoque concept car.The vehicle was unveiled at Lummus Park, Miami, followed by Miami International Airport, followed by Auto China 2014 (with Nazionale configuration via Lamborghini Ad Personam personalization program). The Lamborghini Aventador starred as Lockdown, the film's main antagonist, in Transformers: Age of Extinction.</p>

            <h2>Huracán LP 610-4</h2>
            <p>The Lamborghini Huracán (Spanish for "hurricane") is a sports car built by Lamborghini, replacing Lamborghini's sales leader and most produced car, the Gallardo. The Huracán made its auto show debut at the March 2014 Geneva Auto Show and was released in the second quarter of 2014. The Huracán's name (huracán being the Spanish word for hurricane) is inspired by a Spanish fighting bull, similar to various other Lamborghini car models. Huracán was a bull known for its courage that fought in 1879. Also Huracan is the Mayan god of wind, storm and fire.</p>
            <p>Changes from Gallardo included full LED illumination, a 12.3 inch full-colour TFT instrument panel, Fine Nappa leather and Alcantara interior upholstery, redesigned dashboard and central tunnel, Iniezione Diretta Stratificata (IDS, essentially an adapted version of parent Audi's Fuel Stratified Injection) direct and indirect gasoline injections, engine Stop & Start technology, EU6 emissions regulation compliance, Lamborghini Doppia Frizione (LDF) 7-speed dual clutch transmission with 3 modes (STRADA, SPORT and CORSA), 20 inch wheels, carbon-ceramic brake system, optional Lamborghini Dynamic Steering variable steering system and MagneRide electromagnetic damper control.</p>
            <p>The vehicle was unveiled at the March 2014 Geneva Motor Show and deliveries began in the second quarter of 2014. The Huracán is comparable to the McLaren 650S and the Ferrari 458 (as well as its successor, the 488 GTB).</p>
            <p>The price of the Huracán with extra options added reaches to over US$320,000, or GB£200,000. The base price for the Huracán in the United States is US$241,945, and around GB£180,720 in the UK. Extra options that increase the price of the car include interior enhancements, special paint schemes, improved suspension, and a lifting system, as well as multiple components optionally available in carbon fiber, rather than aluminium. Taiwan models went on sale for NT$15,080,000.[14] In early 2015, the Huracán appeared on the motoring magazine Top Gear. It got a neutral review from Richard Hammond who said that it was too tame to be a "proper Lamborghini." However, it got around the Top Gear test track in 1:15.8 which is faster than any other Lamborghini to go around the track to date, including the Aventador.</p>
